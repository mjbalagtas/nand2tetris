#### This course teaches about building a computer using first principles.
Starting from project 01,need to build a set of elementary logic gates and complex logic gates, that is then abstracted and will serve as interfaces for the next project, that is again abstracted and will be used as interfaces for the next project, and so on, until the last project is reached.

Need to build logic gates/chip:
* And16
* And
* DMux
* DMux4Way
* DMux8Way
* Mux
* Mux4Way16
* Mux8Way16
* Mux16
* Not
* Not16
* Or

* Or16
* Xor

All chips are written using hdl and unit tested using the test scripts available in this course.
